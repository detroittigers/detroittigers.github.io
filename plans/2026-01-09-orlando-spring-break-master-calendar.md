### Week 2: March 16-20, 2026
**Crowd Level: 10/10** 🔴 WORST WEEK - AVOID IF POSSIBLE

| Region | Market | On Break? |

| Florida | Orlando (Orange County) | ✅ YES |
| Florida | Palm Beach, Broward | ✅ YES |
| Florida | Miami-Dade | ❌ No (next week) |
| Texas | Dallas, Fort Worth, Plano, Arlington | ✅ YES |

- **Dallas-Fort Worth** - 2nd largest Texas metro
- **Ontario, Canada** - Largest international feeder market
- **Indianapolis** - Major Midwest city

**This is the collision week.** Four major markets converge.

**Strategy:** Survival mode. Early entry mandatory. Leave park midday. Express Pass most justified this week. Consider literally any other week.

### Week 4: March 30 - April 3, 2026
**Crowd Level: 7/10** 🟡 MODERATE-HIGH

| Region | Market | On Break? |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Michigan | Detroit (Wayne County) | ✅ YES |
| New Jersey | Most districts | ✅ YES |

- **Philadelphia** - Major Northeast city
- **Northern Virginia** - DC suburbs (wealthy, travel frequently)
- **Raleigh/Wake County** - Fast-growing NC market
- **New Jersey** - Entire state basically

**Strategy:** Northeast + Midwest overlap begins. These are generally affluent, well-planned travelers. Expect longer Express Pass lines (they buy it). Sunday still best day.

### Week 5: April 6-10, 2026
**Crowd Level: 6/10** 🟢 IMPROVING

| Region | Market | On Break? |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Michigan | Ann Arbor (still), Grand Rapids (starting) | ✅ YES |
| Georgia | Atlanta metro (all counties) | ✅ YES |
| North Carolina | Charlotte (Mecklenburg) | ✅ YES |
| Ohio | Columbus | ✅ YES |

**Easter Sunday: April 5, 2026** - Creates mini-spike

**Who's there:**
- **Atlanta** - Major Southeast hub
- **Charlotte** - Fast-growing market
- **Columbus** - Ohio's largest city
- **Michigan** - Tail end of various districts

**Strategy:** Post-Easter, crowds thin significantly. Atlanta and Charlotte families tend to drive (not fly), so Saturday arrivals are common. Sunday-Tuesday are your best days.

|--------|--------|-----------|
| Michigan | Grand Rapids (ending) | ✅ Partial |
| Stragglers | Various private schools | Partial |

**Who's there:** Mostly stragglers, private schools, homeschool families

**Strategy:** This is when things normalize. Standard weekend patterns return. You can sleep in. Midday is tolerable. Evening strategy still optimal but less critical.

---

### Week 7: April 20-24, 2026
**Crowd Level: 4/10** ⭐⭐ VERY LIGHT

| Region | Market | On Break? |
|--------|--------|-----------|

## Strategic Recommendations by Market

### For Florida Residents
```
Your break (March 16-20) is THE WORST WEEK.

If you have annual passes: Skip your break week. Visit March 14-15
(before) or March 21-22 (after) instead.

If you must go during break: Tuesday/Wednesday slightly lighter
than weekend.
```

### For Michigan Families
```
Your break (late March/early April) misses the worst crowds.

You arrive as Northeast is finishing and Florida is long gone.
Week 5-6 crowds are manageable.

Sunday still wins. Standard strategy works.
```

### For Texas Families
```
Houston (Week 1): You lucked out. Lightest week of spring break.

Dallas/Fort Worth (Week 2): You're in the collision. Read the
survival guide. Consider Express Pass.
```

### For Northeast Families
```
You hit Week 4-5, after Florida locals leave.

Crowds are elevated but not insane. Pack patience.
NYC gets a long break (April 2-10) - go early in your window
when crowds are slightly lighter.
```

### For Chicago Families
```
You hit Week 3, the "second wave" after Florida clears.

Miami-Dade families are your main competition. Cincinnati too.
Better than Week 2, but still aggressive strategy needed.
```

### For Atlanta/Charlotte Families
```
Week 5 is your friend. Post-Easter, most spring breakers gone.

You're sharing with Columbus and tail-end Michigan.
Standard strategy works. Sleep in. Enjoy.
```

### For Boston Families
```
Week 7 = BEST TIMING.

You're alone. Everyone else went home weeks ago.
Parks are nearly normal. All days are good days.
Congratulations on your school calendar.
```

### For Canadian Families
```
Ontario March Break (Week 2) is the collision.

You share the week with Florida locals, Dallas, and Indy.
Expect peak crowds. Plan aggressively.

Consider: Fly down Week 1 or Week 3 instead of your actual
break if you have flexibility (use vacation days around it).
```

## Express Pass Decision Matrix

| Week | Crowd | Express Worth It? |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | 5/10 | No - strategy beats payment |
| **2** | **10/10** | **Yes - strongly consider** |
| 3 | 8/10 | Maybe - if only 1 day |
| 4 | 7/10 | Maybe - if traveling with young kids |
| 5 | 6/10 | No - strategy works |
| 6 | 5/10 | No |
| 7 | 4/10 | No |

**Reminder:** Epic Universe Express Pass is $160-$330/person depending on date. No Unlimited option exists. One skip per ride.

---

## University/College Spring Breaks

College students travel differently than K-12 families:
- More flexible with timing (skip classes before/after)
- Travel in groups, hit parks later in the day
- More likely to buy Express Pass (splitting costs)
- Stay later at night

### Major University Calendar

| University | Spring Break 2026 | Week # | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| **University of Michigan** | Feb 28 - Mar 8 | Pre-Week 1 | EARLIEST - before spring break season |
| Penn State | Mar 9-13 | Week 1 | Starts the wave |
| University of Florida | Mar 16-20 | Week 2 | Home state collision |
| Florida State | Mar 16-20 | Week 2 | Home state collision |
| UCF | Mar 16-21 | Week 2 | Home state collision |
| Ohio State | Mar 16-20 | Week 2 | Major Midwest school |
| UT Austin | Mar 16-21 | Week 2 | Texas adds to Week 2 |
| NYU | Mar 16-20 | Week 2 | Northeast elite |
| USC | Mar 15-22 | Week 2 | California travelers |
| Georgia Tech | Mar 23-27 | Week 3 | Atlanta area |
| UCLA/UC schools | Mar 21-Apr 4 | Weeks 3-4 | Quarter system = later |

### Key Insights

**Week 2 is even worse than K-12 suggests:**
Most major universities (UF, FSU, UCF, OSU, UT Austin, NYU, USC) all hit March 16-20. This compounds the K-12 collision with Florida + Dallas + Ontario + Indy.

**University of Michigan is the outlier:**
Their Feb 28 - Mar 8 break is BEFORE spring break season even starts. Michigan students get the park nearly to themselves.

**Quarter system schools (UCLA, UC Berkeley, etc.) are later:**
Their breaks fall in late March/early April (Weeks 3-4), spreading out California visitors.
