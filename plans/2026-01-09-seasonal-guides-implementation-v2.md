Here's what our data shows for January 17-19.
```

**Hook paragraph:**
```
Everyone assumes 3-day weekends mean 3-hour waits.

But MLK weekend isn't Christmas week. It's not even close.

We tracked every wait time through the holidays. Now we're watching
the patterns shift. Here's what January 17-19 actually looks like
compared to what you just survived in December.

4. **What Could Go Wrong** - Weather, breakdowns, viral guide effect

- **Disney World** (Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom)
- **SeaWorld Orlando & Busch Gardens Tampa**

### Page Structure

Title: Orlando Spring Break 2026: The Complete Survival Guide
Meta: 7 weeks of spring break chaos at Disney, Universal, and SeaWorld, decoded. Week-by-week patterns, regional calendars, and strategies that actually work.
```

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
```
Spring Break in Orlando:
7 Weeks of Chaos, Decoded
```

**Subhead:**
```
March 9 - April 24, 2026
Disney, Universal, SeaWorld - not all spring break weeks are equal.
Here's what the data shows.
```

### Week-by-Week Reference (From Master Calendar)

| Week | Dates | Crowd | Key Markets | Best Day |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Mar 9-13 | 5/10 | Houston | Sun/Wed |
| **2** | **Mar 16-20** | **10/10** | **FL + Dallas + Ontario + Indy** | **None good** |
| 3 | Mar 23-27 | 8/10 | Miami + Chicago + Cincinnati | Sun |
| 4 | Mar 30-Apr 3 | 7/10 | Detroit + NJ + Philly + NoVA | Sun |
| 5 | Apr 6-10 | 6/10 | Atlanta + Charlotte + Columbus | Sun/Tue |
| 6 | Apr 13-17 | 5/10 | Stragglers | Any weekday |
| 7 | Apr 20-24 | 4/10 | Boston only | Any day |

### K-12 Regional Breakdown (Key Markets)

**Florida:**
- Orange County (Orlando): March 16-20
- Miami-Dade: March 23-27 (one week later!)
- Palm Beach, Broward: March 16-20

**Texas:**
- Houston: March 9-13 (Week 1 - EARLIEST)
- Dallas-Fort Worth: March 16-20 (Week 2)

**Midwest:**
- Chicago: March 23-27
- Detroit (Wayne Co): March 30-April 3
- Indianapolis: March 16-20
- Columbus: April 3-10
- Cincinnati: March 24-27

**Northeast:**
- NYC: April 2-10 (long break)
- Philadelphia: March 30-April 3
- Boston: April 20-24 (LATEST)
- Northern Virginia: March 30-April 3

**Southeast:**
- Atlanta: April 6-10
- Charlotte: April 6-10
- Raleigh: March 30-April 6

**International:**
- Ontario, Canada: March 16-20 (Week 2 collision)

### University/College Spring Break Calendar

**Important:** College students travel differently than K-12 families. They're more flexible, often travel in groups, and hit parks later in the day.

| University | Dates | Week # |
|------------|-------|--------|
| **University of Michigan** | Feb 28 - Mar 8 | Pre-Week 1 (EARLY) |
| Penn State | Mar 9-13 | Week 1 |
| Florida universities (UF, FSU, UCF) | Mar 16-20 | Week 2 |
| Ohio State | Mar 16-20 | Week 2 |
| UT Austin | Mar 16-21 | Week 2 |
| NYU | Mar 16-20 | Week 2 |
| USC | Mar 15-22 | Week 2 |
| Georgia Tech | Mar 23-27 | Week 3 |
| UCLA/UC schools | Mar 21-Apr 4 | Weeks 3-4 (quarter system) |

**Key Insight:** Most major universities hit Week 2 (March 16-20), compounding the K-12 collision. University of Michigan is the notable exception with a late-February break.

### Express Pass Decision Matrix

From research: Epic Universe Express Pass is **$160-$330/person** depending on date. **NO Unlimited option exists.** One skip per ride.

| Week | Crowd | Express Worth It? |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | 5/10 | No - strategy beats payment |
| **2** | **10/10** | **Yes - strongly consider** |
| 3 | 8/10 | Maybe - if only 1 day |
| 4 | 7/10 | Maybe - young kids or limited time |
| 5 | 6/10 | No - strategy works |
| 6 | 5/10 | No |
| 7 | 4/10 | No |

### Regional Callout Sections

Include dedicated sections for major markets:

**"Michigan Families: Your Timing Is Good"**
```
Your break (late March/early April) misses the worst crowds.

You arrive as Northeast is finishing and Florida is long gone.
Week 4-5 crowds are manageable.

University of Michigan students get an even better deal -
their Feb 28-Mar 8 break is BEFORE spring break season starts.
```

**"Florida Residents: You Drew the Short Straw"**
```
Your break (March 16-20) is THE WORST WEEK.

If you have annual passes: Skip your break week. Visit March 14-15
(before) or March 21-22 (after) instead.

If you must go during break: Tuesday/Wednesday slightly lighter
than weekend.
```

**"Canadian Families: March Break Reality"**
```
Ontario March Break (Week 2) is the collision.

You share the week with Florida locals, Dallas, and Indy.
Expect peak crowds. Plan aggressively.

Consider: Fly down Week 1 or Week 3 instead of your actual
break if you have flexibility.
```

### Universal Strategies (Every Week)

1. **Early Entry (EPA)** - 1 hour before general public, mandatory during peak
2. **Evening Window (7 PM - Close)** - Waits drop 40-60%
3. **Midday Escape** - Leave 11 AM - 4 PM, return refreshed
4. **Single Rider Lines** - Where available, use them
5. **Virtual Queues** - Book immediately when available

### Sample Itineraries

1. **1-Day Sprint (Peak Week)** - Aggressive, EPA required, midday break, evening push
2. **2-Day Balanced (Any Week)** - Day 1 headliners, Day 2 relaxed exploration
3. **3-Day Cruise (Lighter Weeks)** - One land per day, evening headliners

### Content Atomization Schedule

**This is the biggest content opportunity of Q1.**

## Brand Voice Reminders

Every guide must sound like:
- A helpful friend who knows the parks
- Someone who's been there, not read about it
- Data-informed but not robotic
- Honest about limitations ("we might be wrong")

Avoid:
- Corporate speak ("We're excited to announce...")
- AI tells (em dashes, "Great question!", excessive exclamation marks)
- Hedging everything ("might possibly perhaps")
- Overselling the app (1-2 mentions max)

**Read aloud test:** If it sounds like a press release, rewrite it.
